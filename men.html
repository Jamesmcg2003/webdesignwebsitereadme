           <h2>European Championship 2024: Germany</h2>
           <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rofunuT0I2M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
           <p style="column-count: 3; column-gap: 5%;"> Ireland began their qualifying campaign for the 2024 european championships on the 27th of March against France. Although the team played well, the class of the french proved too much for Stephen Kenny's side. The game ended in a 1-0 defeat. You can read the match report <a href="https://www.fai.ie/ireland/match/3/2024/2036316?tab=report">here</a> or watch the highlights of the game above. The odds are stacked against Ireland in this qualifying campaign, as they're paired againts former world champions France and a young energetic Netherlands who missed out on a semi finals spot in the world cup only due to a penalty shootout. With only the top two teams qualifying, Ireland have to top one of these european giants. Although Ireland began their campaign with a loss, the team is looking extremely positive and competitive enough to keep up with some of the best. The Netherlands, despite their somewhat succesful world cup campaign, are not up to full speed. Due to medical circumstances, their manager Louis Van Gaal had to step down and was replaced with Ronald Koeman, former Netherlands manager. Koemans recent spells as manager have not been succesful having failed to qualify for the world cup in 2018. His spell at Barcelona was also forgettable having failed to keep up with Real Madrid and producing poor runs in the Champions league and Europa League. Ireland could capatilise on Netherlands new management and gather some results on the run. As for the other two teams in Ireland's group, Greece and Gibraltar, it is seen as must to get 6 points from each team. Ireland's history with Gibraltar is a succesful one, producing high scorelines and generally having a trouble free game. Greece may prove tricky, but the current Greek squad is a shadow of its former self, with Greece failing to qualify for a major tournament since 2014. Also, Ireland place higher in the FIFA rankings tha both these teams. Overall, Ireland will come into this qualifying campaign with belief that they could be playing in Germany in 2024.</p>
